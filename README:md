# Pendulum Coordinates mod for Wurm Unlimited (Server)

Requires [Ago's Server Mod Launcher](https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher/releases) to run.

This mod is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

The mod replaces pendulum logic, which shows you a rough distance to the water source, with actual coordinates. For example, if your coordinates are 100,105 and the nearest water source is 103,107, the text will be:

_"You must go 3w,2n to reach the water source. The water source is at 103,107, while you are at 100,105."_

## Enchanted pendulums haven't been tested yet!
